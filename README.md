Description: 

The project "Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using Unsupervised Machine Learning" aims to address the critical need for robust security measures in today's interconnected world by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The project focuses on developing an effective anomaly detection system tailored specifically for network traffic analysis without relying on labeled examples.

The project begins by acquiring diverse network traffic data from Kaggle, a prominent platform for datasets and machine learning resources. This dataset provides a realistic representation of network behaviors, including both normal activities and potential anomalies, essential for training and evaluating the anomaly detection models.

The methodology encompasses several key stages:

Data Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Pairwise correlations and visualization techniques are employed to understand the structure and characteristics of the network traffic data, aiding in subsequent model selection and interpretation.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: Various unsupervised learning algorithms such as KMeans, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM are implemented.

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Evaluation: The performance of each anomaly detection model is evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score, accuracy, etc.
